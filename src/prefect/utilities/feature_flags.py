# Flags should follow the naming pattern of {ENABLE/DISABLE}_{FEATURE_NAME}.
# The UI consumes some of these via `/api/flags` so that features can
# simultaneously be toggled on and off between the API and the UI.
#
# For example, to create a new feature flag called "enable-cool_feature",
# you would add a variable that contains the flag and call
# `create_if_missing()` like so:
#
# ENABLE_COOL_FEATURE = "very-cool-feature"
# create_if_missing(ENABLE_COOL_FEATURE)
