# The function Prefect should call to get the `FeatureFlagger` instance
# to use for flagging.
flagger_factory: prefect.utilities.feature_flags.get_default_feature_flagger

# Flags should follow the naming pattern of {enable/disable}-{feature-name}.
# The UI consumes some of these via `/api/flags` so that features can
# simultaneously be toggled on and off between the API and the UI.
#
# For example, to create a new feature flag called "enable-cool-feature",
# you would add a variable like so:
#
#flags:
#  very-cool-feature:
#    is_enabled: false
