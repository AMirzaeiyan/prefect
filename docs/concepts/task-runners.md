# Task runners

Task runners are responsible for running Prefect tasks. Each flow has a task runner associated with it. The task runner is started at the beginning of a flow run and shutdown at the end.

Depending on the task runner you use, the tasks within your flow can run in parallel or sequentially. The default task runner is the `SequentialTaskRunner`, which does not run your tasks in parallel. To run tasks in parallel, you can use a task runner such as the `DaskTaskRunner`, which enables Dask-based parallel execution.

## Using an task runner

Import task runners from `prefect.task_runners` and assign them when the flow is defined.

```python hl_lines="4"
from prefect import flow
from prefect.task_runners import DaskTaskRunner

@flow(task_runner=DaskTaskRunner())
def my_flow():
    pass
```

If a task runner type is passed, a task runner instance will be created with the default settings. TaskRunner instances can be passed for additional configuration:


```python hl_lines="4"
from prefect import flow
from prefect.task_runner import DaskTaskRunner

@flow(task_runner=DaskTaskRunner(address="http://my-dask-cluster"))
def my_flow():
    pass
```

## Using multiple task runners

Each flow can only have a single task runner, but sometimes you may want a subset of your tasks to run elsewhere. In this case, you can create [subflows](/concepts/flows/#subflows) to temporarily use a different task runner.

For example, you can have a flow (`my_flow`) that runs its tasks locally, but uses a subflow (`my_subflow`) to run some tasks in a Dask cluster.

```python
from prefect import flow, task
from prefect.task_runners import DaskTaskRunner, SequentialTaskRunner

@task
def hello_local():
    print("Hello!")

@task
def hello_dask():
    print("Hello from Dask!")

@flow(task_runner=SequentialTaskRunner())
def my_flow():
    hello_local()
    my_subflow()
    hello_local()

@flow(task_runner=DaskTaskRunner())
def my_subflow():
    hello_dask()

my_flow()
```

This script outputs the following logs demonstrating the temporary Dask task runner:

## TaskRunner types

See the [`prefect.task_runners` API reference](/api-ref/prefect/task-runners/) for descriptions of each task runner.

Check out the [Dask task runner tutorial](/tutorials/dask-task-runner/) for some common Dask use cases.
